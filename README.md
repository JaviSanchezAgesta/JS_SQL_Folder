# JS_SQL_Folder
SQL Data Analytics Projects

## Objective

This folder contains some of the used functions in the process of learning SQL through the study of a ficticius company case. In this scenario we are analysing customer behaviours for Rockbuster Stealth LLC, a movie rental company planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.

My role is to help Rockbuster with the launch strategy by answering the following questions: 

● Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?

● What was the average rental duration for all videos?

● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?

● Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?

● Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?



## Data

The data set contains movies information about the following parameters: 

•	payment..............• actor...........• customer............• country

• rental...................• film..............• staff...............• store

• film actor...........• language........• address.............• film category

• inventory............• category........• city................ 

The database for PostgreSQL is available [here](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads)

The Rockbuster data set is available [here](http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dvdrental.zip)

## Tools

For this project we used PostgreSQL as a RDBMS (Relational Database Management System)

## Executing the code

The code is available as text, ready to be copied and pasted in PostgreSQL query box and be executed. It may work in different RBDMS or might have slightly different syntax, but the main commands are common to other systems.

## Relevant files

Together with the few commands, I added some files that help with the context and put sense to the analysis:

+ Data Dictionary

+ Constraints table 

+ SQL list of queries in Word format

+ Presentation about Rockbuster with insights
